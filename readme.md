## *Description*
An intro to the concepts covered in this project can be found  [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification). You can test drive this mini app simply by downloading this repository and opening `index.html`.

You can also use the buttons to add training images for the model to learn and predict on.

1. Take a pose or add something to correspond to each class A to D and press corresponding button.

2. If the prediction is not correct add more training data. (See Step 1)
